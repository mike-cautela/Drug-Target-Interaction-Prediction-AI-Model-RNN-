# Drug-Target-Interaction-Prediction-AI-Model-RNN-
A project for my AI for Science Class focusing on predicting drug-target interactions using an RNN. It covers data preprocessing, training, and evaluation, achieving low MSE and MAE. The project explores SMILES and protein sequences for binding affinity predictions with detailed documentation.
