# Drug-Target-Interaction-Prediction-AI-Model-RNN-

Project Overview:

This repository contains a project focused on predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The project was completed as part of an assignment for my AI for Science Class. It explores the application of deep learning to analyze and predict binding affinities between drugs and target proteins based on their molecular and sequential data representations.

Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to build and train an RNN model that can accurately predict the binding affinity (interaction strength) between drugs and target proteins, represented by SMILES strings and amino acid sequences, respectively. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
